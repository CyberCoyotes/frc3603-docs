Cyber Coyotes's Handbook
===================================

Welcome to the documentation place for FRC 3603, the Cyber Coyotes.
We are a small, but dedicated FRC team in central Michigan.
Our aim with this documentation is to share our learning with future team members and the larger FIRST community.
